# Futarchy Monorepo

![License BSLv1.1](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-BSLv1.1-lightgray.svg)

Monorepo that houses programs helpful for futarchy. A description of these programs
and what they do can be found at [docs.themetadao.org](https://docs.themetadao.org).

## Scripts

The scripts folder contains a few scripts that you can use to interact with the Meta-DAO.
Today, the only way to create proposals is via script. You can do this by modifying the
`initializeProposal.ts` script and replacing its `pubkey`, `accounts`, and `data` with the
SVM instruction that you want to use in your proposal.

Then, run `anchor run propose --provider.cluster CLUSTER`, where `CLUSTER` is replaced with
either devnet, mainnet, or (recommended) an RPC URL.
